Server Component
================

Intro
-----

The sync server is a program sitting in the cloud that will deal with backing up notes. The same codebase will contain the web app that the user will interact with on PC.

Sync server
-----------

The sync server will deal with all of the back up/synchronisation capabilities of the system. This will include: 
 - storing notes that the user has enabled backup on
 - calculating diffs on notes to send to clients
 - managing access permissions to notes based on whom the user has shared their notes with


Web app
-------

The web interface for note taking will more or less replicate the functionality of the app. It will allow the user to create, view, edit and delete notes. 


Misc notes
----------

We may have a 'future goal' of paying for video/image storage on the notes server (ie pc access) because that be expensive.
