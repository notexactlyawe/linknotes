Notes app
---------

But allow embedding/linking of other media
 - sound
 - image
 - other text
 - videos

web but for notes
 - bc links
 - seeing links makes it easier to follow/more logical

edit/view on multiple platforms

Visual representation of relationships between content
 - not basic premise
 - potential future thing
 - have some kind of diagram

links should be two way

Tracked media should be viewable from within app

(media is image/video/sound/note etc)

Notes should be organisable (folder-type things)

Sidebar should be scrollable



Write down general what we think it should do

User stories (at least 4)

UI mock ups

Basic architecture

Split up some tasks
