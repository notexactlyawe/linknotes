LinkNotes
=========

LinkNotes is a learning project to create a note-taking app. The core concept is that a note can be created and other media (including other notes) can be linked or embedded within. This allows the user to store information more logically and understand the relations between information better.

The project is aimed at helping us better understand Android and Java, but we will be using other technologies and gaining experience with them. For example, we hope to use Elixir and Phoenix for the back end sync and share server.

The Android project can be found in LinkNotes and the Phoenix app can be found in notes_server.

Both planning and documentation of the project can be found in the docs folder.

It is being undertaken by [Agnieszka WÄ…sikowska](https://github.com/aga11313) and [Cameron MacLeod](https://github.com/notexactlyawe).
