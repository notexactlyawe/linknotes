LinkNotes
=========

LinkNotes is a learning project to create a note-taking app. The core concept is that a note can be created and other media (including other notes) can be linked or embedded within. This allows the user to store information more logically and understand the relations between information better.

Both planning and documentation of the project can be found in the docs folder.

It is being undertaken by [Agnieszka WÄ…sikowska](https://github.com/aga11313) and [Cameron MacLeod](https://github.com/notexactlyawe).
